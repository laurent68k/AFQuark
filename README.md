## Introduction
AFQuark is my first framework in development available online as a pod with Cocoapod. The goal is to have some nice to have piece of code to help quickly to develop an iOS App.

Currently in dev, don't use it as a pod. It's my playground zone.

## Swift 4.2
Requires Xcode 10 and Swift 4.2.

## Installation
Drop in the AFQuark/Sources folder to your Xcode project (make sure to enable "Copy items if needed" and "Create groups").

Or via CocoaPods, seek this GIT repository from your podfile :
```
use_frameworks!
pod 'AFQuark', :git => 'https://github.com/laurent68k/AFQuark.git'
```

In the `Podfile` directory (where is your Xcode project), type:

```bash
$ pod install
```
